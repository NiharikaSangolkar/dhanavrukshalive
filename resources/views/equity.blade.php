                <p>
                    An equity derivative is a financial instrument whose value is based on the equity movements of the underlying asset.
                    For example, a stock option is an equity derivative, because its value is based on the price movements of the underlying stock.

                <p>Equity derivatives can act like an insurance policy. The investor receives a potential payout by paying the cost of the derivative contract, which is referred to as a premium in the options market. An investor that purchases a stock, can protect against a loss in share value by purchasing a put
                    option. On the other hand, an investor that has shorted shares can hedge against an upward move in the share price by purchasing a call option.</p>
                <p>Equity derivative can also be used for speculation purposes. For example, a trader can buy equity options, instead of actual stock, to generate profits from the underlying assetâ€™s price movements. </p>
