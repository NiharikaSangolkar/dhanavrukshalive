      <h1>What is Mutual Fund?</h1>
      <p>
        A mutual fund is a financial vehicle that pools money from multiple investors to purchase securities like stocks, bonds, and other assets. Managed by professional portfolio managers, mutual funds provide individual investors access to diversified portfolios and professional management, which can help reduce the risks associated with individual security investments. By investing in a mutual fund, you own shares in the fund, which represents a portion of the fundâ€™s holdings.

                    <h3>Professional Management</h3>
                    <p>The primary advantage of funds is the professional management of your money. Investors purchase
                        funds because they do not have the time or the expertise to manage their own portfolio. A mutual
                        fund is a relatively inexpensive way for a small investor to get a full-time manager to make and
                        monitor the investments.</p>

                    <h3>Economies of Scale</h3>
                    <p>Because a mutual fund buys and sells large amounts of securities at a time, its transaction costs
                        are lower than you as an individual would pay.</p>

                    <h3>Simplicity</h3>
                    <p>Buying a mutual fund is easy! The minimum investment is also very small. As little as Rs. 500 can
                        be invested on a monthly basis. Just contact us to know more.</p>

            <h1>History of Mutual Fund</h1>
            <p>The origin of the mutual fund industry in India was with the introduction of the concept of mutual funds
                by UTI in the year 1963. It accelerated from the year 1987 when non-UTI players entered the industry. In
                the past decade, the Indian mutual fund industry has seen dramatic improvements, both quality-wise and
                quantity-wise.</p>
